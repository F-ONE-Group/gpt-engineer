Your goal is to build a fully functional action module as an F-ONE developer.
The project already contained the main structure and you goal is to complete the main.py, utils.py and constants.py with the code that it has been ask you to program. 
The action module should use the process variables, already passed as Payload Object, and: 

1) get the exchange rate at the process_variables.fhs_date of process_variable.currency using https://api.exchangerate.host/convert endpoint. 
2) using the exchange rate for converting process_variables.estimate_amount_of_damage to the amount in EUR. This function should also return the ratio between the converted estimate_amount_of_damage and process_variables.claim_amount
3) calculate elapsed days between process_variables.first_written_claim and process_variables.damage_date. If damage_date is None or process_variables.reason is investigation use process_variables.fhs_date
4) process the business rules providing the process_variables. 
the name of the rule should be follow the logic: 
process_variables.client = Byrd then validation_rules_byrd
process_variables.client = 7Senders then validation_rules_7s

You need to use as much as possible the f_one_core_utilities package. Only if it is not possible to use one the available modules and methods, you can come up with your own function. 
You need to use the already existing files utils.py and main.py available in the same folder.
All the support functions should be created in utils.py script, while the main.py should remain as simple a possible.
